       <h2>To Kill a Mockingbird</h2>
       <p>Author : Harper Lee</p>
       <p>Review :To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee. It was published in June 1960 and became instantly successful. In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American literature; a year after its release, it won the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten. </p>

       <h2>1984</h2>
       <p>Author : George Orswell</p>
       <p>Review : The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.</p>

       <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
       <p>Author : Jane Austen</p>
       <p>Review : Austen's novel teaches you about healthy love amongst other things. About how necessary it is to analyze our flaws and get them fixed ourselves rather than wait for the other one to step up. About how prejudices and feelings of pride can blind even the best of souls. About the worth of the right relationships.</p>
