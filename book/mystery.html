        <h2>Death at the Doorstep</h2>
        <p>Author : Linda W.Fitzegerald</p>
        <p>Review : The death has a warrant in its hands, whose name is at the top today? Death, the eternal truth, the fact which is breath-taking, sad, gloomy. Everyone looks at death from a different aspect. Some consider it to be the end of life, and for some it is beginning of a new life. Some feel that dying is changing bodies by the souls. Some feel that death is being nothing. And some feel that it is a full-stop to everything.</p>
