            <h2>The Sun and Her Flowers</h2>
            <p>Author: Rupi Kaur</p>
            <p>Review :This is one of the books which one can read untold number of times. Rupi Kaur brings out all the preeminent emotions that we all living beings go through in our lives at some point or the other.
                The strong suit of her writing is that she expresses these otherwise compound emotions in the most discernible way anyone can ever do!
                This book is divided into five phases of emotions which are aptly compared to the Sunflowers as they wilt, fall, root, rise and bloom.

            <h2>Devotions</h2>
            <p>Author: Mary Oliver</p>
            <p>Review : Mary Oliverâ€™s Devotions provides a fitting culmination of her life philosophy, her core tenets bound together in one vulnerable place. Ultimately, her work divulges with astute observation the crux of
                what we are: at once human and animal, at once selfish and full of gratitude, at once perfect and profoundly flawed. </p>

      <h3>Leaves of Grass</h3> 
      <p>Author :Walt Whitman </p> 
      <p>Review : Leaves of Grass is a rolling cascade of language that entrances with its steady rhythm. It is an impossibly ambitious attempt to capture the American world in ballad that attempts the impossible. Walt Whitman attempts to capture the world he is surrounded by and we get glimpses of hills and people and rivers and deserts and fields and workers as he explores it. It becomes, after a while, a rollicking ride through the recesses of consciousness. </p>
